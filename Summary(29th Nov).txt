Full Process : 
Continious Integration :

-> Developers Commits the code to SCM (Github, SVN, Subversion)
-> Jenkins will pull that code for build through maven commands.
-> In between the build procedure It will clean the existing artifact cache.\
-> Analyze the code 
-> In Analyze the code : 
-----> Syntaxt Error
-----> Check Syyle Error
After that calculate the sonar code coverage
Sonar Code Coverage -> Code Coverage : 80%
---------------------> Test Results : 95%
---------------------> Major and Minor exception : 0

-> After that upload it to the Nexus (Package/Artifact)


Continious Delivery : 

-> Jenkins request the code from Nexus with plugins
-> Deploy it to the Rundeck (Chef(OS And Softwares) and Ansible(Configuration))


Our Respon : 
 -> Creating the jenkins Pipeline 
-> Modifing
-> Provide Permissions to groups
-> Triuble shoot the CI Plan

in CD : Configure the pipeline for CD
-> TS like validate our jenkins access to Rundeck and 
ensure Jenkin Config pertaining to rundeck is corrent or no
